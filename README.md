# Pycord-Casca

I started this project using the discordpy lib but due to slash command implementation (which will be default for discord applications soon) on pycord i decided to use it as my discord api implement

To use this bot install the required libs on requirements.txt and set up your discord token and database info with the config.json then run bot.py
